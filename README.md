# Test-Case-for-Intermedia
Test Case for Project Management Internship @ Intermedia Cloud Communications, february 2022.

## Intermedia Unite app - review
After exploring Intermedia Unite application, I
want to list some details from my point of view.
I’ve had installed Windows and iOS applications and I did the whole list of call
tests with another intern candidate, Maryana. Although the main specifics are listed
out of Windows application, I’ve decided to note the mobile app as an ideally
developed product where every detail is convenient (for me, personally).
I will attach screenshots of tested cases below. Let me highlight the features I like
the most: 

- User Experience 

  At a first glance, Unite was convenient for me as a unprejudiced user. This
product is efficient and generally easy to use.

- Conciseness

  Unite is fit only with useful options: none of them was unhelpful during my
application test.

- Push notifications

  I really love the notification design (on
PC). It is minimalistic and pleasant to
user’s sight.

- User’s external number with ‘|’
symbol in iPhone calls is excellent! 

  This
can be one of the most convenient
telecom features I’ve ever seen. Getting
off the topic, I used to work as intern
system administrator: when you have
almost 50 people you daily interact
with, sometimes you forget their
additional numbers.

These moments are globally describing the ergonomics of the product. I
understand, that small things do the biggest impact and make the first impression.
Of course, there were the small features I noticed as a user, as such as call parking,
call flip - to be honest, I’ve ran into these functions for the first time. I also like the
sound design, notifications, the call beep, the voicemail message.
Nevertheless, I’ve found a couple of moments I would recommend to elaborate
as potential project manager. There are some user stories on the next pages with
following acceptance criteria, that ought to clarify my opinion. 

## User Stories

- US-01: As a chat member, I want to have an ability to click on the user
pictures or user names, so that I could obtain an information about him
right in chat.

Acceptance criteria (as a testcase):

- Scenario: user participates in
conversation with N number of members
and wants to make a call or obtain an
information about another member.
- Given: I am a chat member and I am on
the chat page (tab).
- When I move my mouse cursor onto some user’s name or profile picture
and click onto them…
- Then I see the summary profile information and get a possibility to call or
text the user.

For example, we already have this function in a chat list:

- US-02: As a chat member, I want emojis, reactions and actions menu to
be changed to permanent button on the corner of the message, so that I
won’t accidentally click on any buttons.

Now, when you click onto small button, the same menu appears. This can also
appear after holding the cursor for a half of a second on the button. Menu
development is not included in this task scope.

- US-03: As a video call participant, I want the ‘tete-a-tete’ call to be
opened in a new tab on the main screen, so that I will not duplicate
windows. 

<img src="https://sun9-43.userapi.com/impg/3NXMPDdrRym-yFo4VDodYbeWxFoJJ9ykuppOqw/9NKu-Bo-Uwo.jpg?size=1071x605&quality=96&sign=41b9519c926d6925b0c5ff157ed1c374&type=album">

Acceptance criteria (as unfunctional requirements):
1. The tab list is expanded with new button during the call.
2. The icon size is 22x22 px, the tab size in 70x70 px.
3. A new tab can be enlightened with a brighter grey color (to identify the
permanent and temporary tab), whilst the icon could be HEX green #2bf01d,
for user to understand he’s ‘on call’.

In simple terms, I would like to split a private video call and group call. I guess,
current format of videocall is really comfortable when you have a group of people
to call, e.g.: planned meeting, Scrum retrospective, brainstorming et cetera – plural
number of participants. When we make a private call, we don’t have to leave the
main screen, not to duplicate windows.

- US-04: As an application user, I want to move the parts of the interface,
to customize my window. 

Acceptance criteria for this task:
User points his mouse cursor on the border
of two blocks, expand icon (shown in the
picture) appears, user can compress it
approximately to 25% (in scale of attached
example) or expand it to 40%.

As a result, chat list block becomes narrow. Text and chosen dialogue compress due
to responsive design – it adapts for the size of the window.

P.S.: I like Windows’ taskbar. You can make it pinned or customize its position on
the screen (move it to the left edge, right edge, or on the top). It’s not the necessary
point to have this depth of the function, but little shifting of chat list block would be
enough.

Hopefully, my appraisal hasn’t been shown sharp for you and Unite
developers might work over these improvement suggestions. On the other hand, I’ve
just listed some examples that came into my head. I’ve tried to solve this task
creatively and I strongly believe I could help Intermedia team to add or improve
some helpful options in the future, to make the product better, considering that I’m
really interested in CaaS field.
